inline caching for YL_KEY and YL_SETKEY
    when we do a lookup, we check if the klass is the same as the
    previous time we did the lookup, and if it is, we know the
    resulting index.  it's a kind of self-modifying code.

threaded dispatch for interpreter switch.

type inference so that doubles can be worked on without casting.  casts would
be made explicit in the bytecode.
